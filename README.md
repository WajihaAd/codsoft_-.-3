# Password Generator

The Password Generator is a simple tool developed using Python's tkinter library. It allows users to generate random passwords of a specified length.

## Libraries Used

- **tkinter**: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library used for creating the user interface.
- **random**: Python's standard library used for generating random numbers and selections.
- **tqdm**: A fast, extensible progress bar library for Python and CLI (Command Line Interface) applications. It provides a progress bar with real-time updates during password generation.
- **time**: Python's standard library used for time-related functions.
- **threading**: Python's standard library used for creating and managing threads to execute tasks concurrently.

## Functionality

- Users can specify the length of the password they want to generate.
- The application then generates a random password using a combination of alphanumeric characters, symbols, and special characters.
- Password generation progress is displayed using a progress bar, providing real-time feedback to the user.
- After password generation, the generated password is displayed in the user interface.
- If any error occurs during password generation, an error message is displayed to the user.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the tqdm library using the following command:

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

3. Run the following command in your terminal to execute the application:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

4. The Password Generator window will appear on your screen, allowing you to generate passwords.
